# PlayerUnknown.NET

``PlayerUnknown.NET`` is a library used to work with PUBG, a game by BlueHole.

## Projects

This library is made (for the moment) of two projects :
 - ``PlayerUnknown`` (the main library)
 - ``PlayerUnknown.Sniffer`` (capturing network packets)
 
You can have an example of how to use the 'PlayerUnknown.Sniffer' library with the demo project, 'PlayerUnknown.Radar', still WIP.
